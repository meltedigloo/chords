# chords
A small utility to compose MIDI music using Windows API's which should still work on modern Windows.
Created many years ago by myself (melted_igloo) as a student project, sadly I do not have the source code, it lies on an
FTP server I no longer have access to.
Feel free to use it for whatever wish.
